Obvious Survey Scam Pattern:

- None of those currencies exist in KoGaMa
- Checking only for Username, which I must say - is actually quite rare with such type of websites, but that simply means it remains unchecked.
- Fake loading bar, it pauses at around 44% (at least by far of my testing) and prompts that the resources have been used out, it asks you to wait and try using another means from their website, lol.
- Ends up with a survey scam.
