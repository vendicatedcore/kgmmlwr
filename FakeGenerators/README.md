# KoGaMa "Free Gold" Scam Tracker  

⚠️ **Warning**: These are fake KoGaMa gold/generator sites. **They don’t work**—they’re scams (phishing, malware, or surveys for profit).  

### What’s Here?  
- A list of shady "free KoGaMa gold" sites I’ve found  
- How they try to trick people (fake progress bars, "human verification", etc.)  
- Notes on their domain names/patterns  

### Why?  
Just a hobby project. I’m curious how these scams work and want to document them.  

### Common Tricks:  
1. **"Enter your KoGaMa username"** → Likely trying to phish detail for stealing account.  
2. **"Complete a survey/download an app"** → They earn money from ads/viruses.  
3. **"Wait X minutes"** → Fake countdowns to make you stay.  

### Don’t:  
- Enter your real password anywhere.  
- Download their "generator" files (likely viruses).  
- Believe "proof" videos (they’re edited).
